# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# 1. Seed the topics

#topics = Topic.create([
#  { :name => "Atrial fibrillaiton" },
#  { :name => "Heart failure" },
#  { :name => "Hypertension" },
#  { :name => "Aortic stenosis" }
#  ])
#
# Seed the links
#
#links = Link.create([
#	{ :name => "Google", :path => "www.google.com", :topic_id => 1 }
